 Welcome to B-Consortium AS/A Level Physics, Ladies and Gentleman, (Zainematics would probably say: Hey babies, let's learn Meth). My name is Aitzaz Imtiaz... if you probably opened my work accidentally. I am just a demb guy, eh, call me emo cz why not. Apart from the ruined professional mess, you can learn more about me on my homepage <a href="https://aitzazimtiaz.github.io/">here</a>. Warning: Gworls do net open ut... I am an ugly nerd.

  Let's maintain professional stuff now

  <h1>Kinematics</h1>
  <h2>Uncertainities</h2>
  Let us denote a system $y$ such that it is a measurable physical quantity. It cannot be always measured in a fixed value, due to limitations. Assume $x$ to be the size of such quantity, to approach a specific value, we go:
$$\lim_{x \to a} a = a,$$
