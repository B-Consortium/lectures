 Welcome to B-Consortium AS/A Level Physics, Ladies and Gentleman, (Zainematics would probably say: Hey babies, let's learn Meth). My name is Aitzaz Imtiaz... if you probably opened my work accidentally. I am just a demb guy (genuine claim: I am a published author in computational research at Harvard DataVerse backed by Harvard College), eh, call me emo cz why not. Apart from the ruined professional mess, you can learn more about me on my homepage <a href="https://aitzazimtiaz.github.io/">here</a>. Warning: Gworls do net open ut... I am an ugly nerd.

  Let's maintain professional stuff now

  <h1>Kinematics</h1>
  <h2>Uncertainities</h2>
  Let us denote a system $y$ such that it is a measurable physical quantity. It cannot be always measured in a fixed value, due to limitations. Assume $x$ to be the size of such quantity, to approach a specific value, we go:
$$\lim_{x \to a} a = a,$$ 
    where we agree that certain limitations exist. Such trivial errors arise in nature because of errors ranging in the domain of Accuracy and Precision. In detailed analysis:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Criteria</th>
        <th>Accuracy</th>
        <th>Precision</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Definition</td>
        <td>Measure of how close a measurement is to the true or expected value.</td>
        <td>Measure of how consistent and exact a measurement or result is.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Focus</td>
        <td>Focuses on the overall correctness of a measurement or classification.</td>
        <td>Focuses on the ability to make precise and consistent measurements or classifications.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Formula</td>
        <td>(True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Predictions</td>
        <td>True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Example</td>
        <td>Out of 100 predictions, 90 are correct.</td>
        <td>Out of 100 positive predictions, 85 are actually positive.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
